## **\* Data preparation -\> eg. There could be cases where we can't just apply analysis from pure data**

For example, if we want to calculate the penetration rate of a technology (e.g., mobile phones or internet), we need to account for variations in the number of households across townships.

-   Some townships could have more households = more numbers of devices \[potentially distorting to seem like they have higher adoption rates\]

(Could / by no. of household) -\> (x/Total households \* 1000) \[can be 100/1000/10k dependings\]

**Without modification to the data:**

**By using penetration rate instead:**

# **Correlation Analysis \[corrplot.mixed()\]**

find out which two are the most correlated (higher = more correlated)

::: callout-note
COMPUTER_PR and INTERNET_PR are highly correlated

This suggest that only one of them should be used in the cluster analysis instead of both

## **Computing** **hierarchical clustering**

::: callout-note
This group up similar locations. Those in the same line group have more similarity.

EG. Left 1st and 2nd have more similarity \> 3rd and 4th
