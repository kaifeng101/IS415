# Purpose of Geospatial Analytics

-   So that we can quantitatively derive it (eg. using KDE).

-   Uses data related to locations to find patterns & trends

# Spatial Point Patterns

-   To study how points (Event) are spread out over an area

-   **Only map Events, no 'Non-Event'**

-   The mapped pattern should not be:

    -   selection bias

    -   Not a sample (eg. It is ok to take aged 70-80 from the population. But **do not do random sampling out of this group**)

# Real-world spatial point patterns -Random OR Patterned?

-   hard to have random distribution

    -   eg. Some areas like the airport will never have childcare

    -   We can use **2nd Order Spatial Point Pattern Analysis** to prove

-   hard to find something uniform in real world

    -   eg. For instance a desert, if you zoom out a bit, there could be small hills, different land. It would not be the same across such as flat land

-   Before performing any spatial analysis, **exclude areas that is definitely dont have the occurence. \[Else, when generate the spatial random data, you might have childcare center there\]**

# Spatial Point Patterns Analysis

-   usually in 2D space

-   set X = {x ∈ D}, **D = study region**, **subset of Rn, a** n-dimensional **Euclidean space**

-   Issue: We need infer if the given is **merely random** or result of some process:

# 1st-order\[Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)\]

-   used to estimate the probability density function of a random variable.

![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-20b.png){width="311"}

### Steps in KDE

1.  Place a Kernel on Each Point (event location)
    -   The height and shape of this bump depend on the chosen kernel function and the bandwidth.
2.  Sum the Kernels
    -   For each point in the study area, the contribution of all surrounding kernels is summed to calculate the density value at that point.
3.  Create a Continuous Surface
    -   The result is a smooth surface where higher values indicate areas with higher event densities, and lower values indicate areas with fewer events.

### KDE Methods

![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-22.jpg){width="371"}

1.  **Uniform** -\> intensity will not change during this period, immediately after, it will be 0

2.  **Triangular** -\> move away from center point, it will decrease very fast from the center point

3.  **Quartic & Gaussian** -\>

    -   not identical, but similar. If get negative value from Gaussian, can switch to Quartic.

    -   **Gaussian** is very common (**Gives more weight to points closer to the event & less weight to points farther away)**

    -   Try different option, select the appropriate one & explain why

### Steps

+------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1.  Divide the study area into subregion of equal size,    | ![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-12.jpg) |
|                                                            |                                                                              |
|     -   often squares, but don’t have to be.               |                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2.  Count the frequency of events in each region.          | ![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-13.jpg) |
+------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3.  Calculate the intensity of events in each region.      | ![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-14.jpg) |
+------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4.  Calculate the quadrat statistics and perform CSR test. | ![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-15.jpg) |
+------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Uniform distribution** -\> variance-mean ratio = 0

**Random distribution** -\> variance-mean ratio **close to 1**

**Cluster distribution** -\> variance-mean ratio **greater than 1**

### Interpretation

![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-17.jpg){width="410"}

### Weaknesses

-   sensitive to the quadrat size

    -   If too small, they may contain only a couple of points, and

    -   If too large, they may contain too many points.

-   It is a measure of **dispersion** rather than a measure of **pattern**.

<!-- -->

-   It results in a single measure for the entire distribution, so variation within the region are not recognised.

# Complete Spatial Randomness CSR

-   satisfy 2 conditions

    -   any event has equal probability of being in any location, a **1st order** effect

    -   The location of one event is independent of the location of another event, a **2nd order** effect.

# 1st-order \[**Distance-based:** Nearest Neighbour Index\]

-   Direct distance from a point to its nearest neighbour

-   Index \< 1: clustering

-   Index = 1: random

-   Index \> 1: dispersion

Example:

![](images/clipboard-3457834433.png){width="425"}

![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-30.jpg){width="438"}

**p-value is \< 0.05, so reject null hypo that the point patterns are randomly distributed**

# 2nd-order \[G function\]

![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-32.jpg){width="230"}

-   within this radius, how many childcare i found

-   Within 0-9, what is the intensity

-   **Clustered**: If G increases rapidly at short distance

-   **Evenness**: If G increases slowly up to distance where most events spaced, then increases rapidly

### Monte Carlo simulation test of CSR

![](images/clipboard-3416485639.png)

-   nsim = 999 **\<- Performed 999 simulations \[Cannot do 1 only, the more = more stable, result will converge\]**

-   for each simulated point pattern, estimate G(r) & use the max 95th and min 5th of these functions for the simulated patterns to define an upper and lower simulation envelope.

-   **Estimate G(r) is statistically significant** if estimated G(r) lies above the upper envelope or below the lower envelope

![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-35.jpg){width="365"}

# 2nd-order \[F function\]

-   Select a sample of point locations anywhere in the study region at random

    -   Determine min distance from each point to any event in the study area.

    ![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-36.jpg){width="527"}

-   **Clustered** = F(r) rises slowly at first, but more rapidly at longer distances.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Evenness** = F(r) rises rapidly at first, then slowly at longer distances.

# Comparison between F and G function

![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-38.jpg)

# 2nd-order \[K function\]

-   Limitation of nearest neighbor distance method is that it uses only nearest distance

-   Considers only the shortest scales of variation.

-   K function uses more points.

    -   Provides an estimate of spatial dependence over a wider range of scales.

    -   Based on all the distances between events in the study area.

    -   Assumes isotropy over the region.

![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-39.jpg){width="343"}

### Calculating K function

-   Construct a circle of radius h around each point event(i).

-   Count the number of other events (j) that fall inside this circle.

-   Repeat these two steps for all points (i) and sum results.

-   Increment h by a small amount and repeat the calculation.

![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-42.jpg){width="446"}

Significant **cluster** pattern -\> above envelop

Significant **regular** pattern -\> below envelop

**CSR** -\> inside envelop

# 2nd-order \[L function\]

-   K function will be normalised to obtained a benchmark of zero.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   When an observed L value is greater than its corresponding L(theo)(i.e. red break line) value for a particular distance and above the upper confidence envelop, spatial clustering for that distance is statistically significant (e.g. distance beyond C).

-   When an observed L value is greater than its corresponding L(theo) value for a particular distance and lower than the upper confidence envelop, spatial clustering for that distance is statistically NOT significant (e.g. distance between B and C).

-   When an observed L value is smaller than its corresponding L(theo) value for a particular distance and beyond the lower confidence envelop, spatial dispersion for that distance is statistically significant. - When an observed L value is smaller than its corresponding L(theo) value for a particular distance and within the lower confidence envelop, spatial dispersion for that distance is statistically NOT significant (e.g. distance between A and B).

![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson03/img/image4-44.jpg){width="393"}

-   L(r)\>0 indicates that the observed distribution is geographically concentrated.

-   L(r)\<0 implies dispersion.

-   L(r)=0 indicates complete spatial randomness (CRS).

\* Anything outside of envelop, you will have enough statistical evidence, if inside means you still fall into the confidence lvl (cannot reject null, cause not enough evidence to infer)

# set.seed()

-   to produce reproducible result

-   result from algo might change every run, use this to fix it
