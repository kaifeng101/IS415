# **Introduction**

### Drug Abuse Overview

-   **Global Impact**: Drug abuse has severe health, financial, and social consequences.

-   **Prevalence**: In 2021, 1 in 17 people aged 15–64 worldwide used a drug in the past year.

-   **Growth Trend**: Drug users increased from 240 million in 2011 to 296 million in 2021.

### Drug Situation in Thailand

-   **Geopolitical Context**: Proximity to the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia)), a major drug production area, makes Thailand a key market and transit route for drug trafficking.

-   **Youth Drug Abuse**:

    -   Approximately 2.7 million young people in Thailand use drugs.

    -   Around 300,000 youth aged 15-19 need drug treatment.

    -   Vocational students are nearly twice as involved with drugs compared to secondary-school students.![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/img/th_ex2_img1.png)

**This Geospatial Analytics will Focus on:**

-   **Objective:** Determine if drug abuse indicators in Thailand show spatial dependence.
-   **Analysis Goals**:
    -   Identify clusters, outliers, and hotspots of drug abuse.

    -   Examine how these patterns change over time.

# **1.0 Setup**

## 1.1 Installing R-Packages

::: panel-tabset
## *Importing and Transforming Data*

-   `sf`:

    -   For handling spatial vector data and transforming it into simple features (`sf`) objects.

    -   Functions like `st_read()` for importing spatial data and `st_transform()` for coordinate reference system transformations.

-   `tidyverse`: For data manipulation and transformation, including functions for working with `tibble` data frames.

-   `readr`: For reading in CSV or other text-based data files if needed.

-   `dplyr`: provide data manipulation capabilities (eg. to group and summarize the relationships between these columns)

-   `arrow`: To read parquet files

## *Displaying Maps*

-   `tmap`: For creating thematic maps and displaying KDE layers.

-   `ggplot2`: For additional custom visualizations if needed.

-   *`scales`*: Transform the unit of measurement for coordinate

-   `animation, png, magick`: For animation work

## *Spatial Autocorrelation*

-   `sfdep`: For performing both local and global spatial autocorrelation analysis
:::

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, sf, readr, ggplot2, tmap, dplyr, arrow, sfdep, scales, animation, png, magick, patchwork)
```

<br/>

## 1.2 Data Acquisition

We will be using 2 sets of data:

::: panel-tabset
## Drug offenses Data

-   **Source:** [[Thailand Drug Offenses \[2017-2022\]]{.underline}](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-drug-offenses-2017-2022)

-   **Study Period:** 2017-2022

## Administrative Boundaries

-   **Source:** [Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tha?) at HDX.
-   **Province Boundaries**: For understanding conflict distribution across larger administrative divisions.
:::

<br/>

## 1.3 Importing Geospatial Data into R

::: panel-tabset
## Drug Offenses Data

```{r}
#| eval: false
drug_offenses_df <- read_parquet("data/drug_offense/thai_drug_offenses_2017_2022.parquet")
```

```{r}
drug_offenses <- read_csv("data/drug_offense/thai_drug_offenses_2017_2022.csv")
```

::: callout-note
Since the data in CSV and Parquet formats are identical, we only need to import one of these file types.
:::

## Administrative Boundaries

```{r}
province_boundaries <- st_read(dsn = "data/subnational_administrative_boundary", layer="tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121")
```
:::

<br/>

## 1.4 Checking Geospatial Data

::: panel-tabset
## Drug Offenses Data

```{r}
class(drug_offenses)
```

::: callout-note
Since

-   Since the class of **drug_offenses** != sf object

we have to transform it.
:::

## Administrative Boundaries

```{r}
class(province_boundaries)
st_crs(province_boundaries)
```

::: callout-note
Since Coordinate Reference System of **province_boundaries**

is in 4326 (unit of measurement = degree), we have to transform it
:::
:::

<br/>

## 1.6 Data Preparation and Wrangling

::: panel-tabset
## Drug Offenses Data

```{r}
# Drop & Rename column
drug_offenses <- drug_offenses %>% 
  select(fiscal_year, types_of_drug_offenses, no_cases, province_en) %>% 
  rename(
    year = fiscal_year,
    offense_type = types_of_drug_offenses,
    case_count = no_cases,
    province_name = province_en
  )
```

## Administrative Boundaries

##### Transform the Coordinate Reference System of these:

```{r}
province_boundaries <- province_boundaries %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4240)
```

```{r}
# Drop & Rename column
province_boundaries <- province_boundaries %>% 
  select(Shape_Leng, Shape_Area, ADM1_EN, ADM1_PCODE, geometry) %>% 
  rename(
    province_name = ADM1_EN,
    province_code = ADM1_PCODE
  )
```

##### Sample plot

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggplot(data = province_boundaries) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Map of Geometries",
       subtitle = "Displaying multipolygon geometries",
       caption = "Source: Example Data")
```

## Understanding the Data

```{r}
# Filter for unmatched province_names between Drug Offenses & Province Boundaries data set
unmatched_provinces <- drug_offenses %>%
  left_join(province_boundaries, by = "province_name") %>%
  filter(is.na(Shape_Leng)) %>%
  select(province_name)

unmatched_provinces <- unique(unmatched_provinces) #Loburi, buogkan



# Transform the province_name in the Drug Offenses dataset
drug_offenses <- drug_offenses %>%
  mutate(province_name = case_when(
    province_name == "Loburi" ~ "Lop Buri",
    province_name == "buogkan" ~ "Bueng Kan",
    TRUE ~ province_name  # Keep the original name if no match
  ))


# Assign each drug offense to a province
drug_offenses_by_province <- drug_offenses %>%
  left_join(province_boundaries, by = "province_name")

# Check for any empty attributes in the test dataset
empty_attributes <- sapply(drug_offenses_by_province, function(column) any(is.na(column)))

# Identify columns with missing values
missing_columns <- names(empty_attributes[empty_attributes]) # character(0) = No missing Column
```

::: callout-warning
The **Drug Offenses** dataset has some naming issues with `province_name`.

We found two discrepancies: **Loburi** should be changed to **Lop Buri**, and **buogkan** should be updated to **Bueng Kan** to match the **Province Boundaries** dataset.

We will update the `province_name` entries in the **Drug Offenses** dataset accordingly.s

# 2.0 Understanding the Data

```{r}
offense_type <- unique(drug_offenses_by_province$offense_type) 
print(offense_type)
```

::: callout-note
These varying degrees of offense types may reveal patterns and trends in drug-related activities, providing a comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand.

::: callout-note
To derive spatial autocorrelation, we first gather the relevant geographic points for our study area:

1.  **Filtering for Unique Geographic Points**: The `summary_stats` dataset contains multiple entries for each geographic point across different years. We filter it to retain data for a single year (e.g., 2017) to work with a unique set of locations.

2.  **Identifying Neighbors**: To assess the spatial relationships between areas, we identify neighboring regions. We use Queen's contiguity weights, which include all neighbors that touch at edges or corners, capturing comprehensive spatial interactions.

3.  **Calculating Weights**: After identifying neighbors, we calculate spatial weights that quantify the influence neighboring areas have on one another. These weights are crucial for measuring spatial autocorrelation, as they inform how a variable in one area relates to values in its neighbors.

## 2017: An Initial Overview

### Global Moran' I

::: panel-tabset
## Computing Global Moran’ I

```{r}
moranI_2017 <- global_moran(wm_q_2017$total_cases,
                       wm_q_2017$nb,
                       wm_q_2017$wt)

glimpse(moranI_2017)
```

## Performing Global Moran’s I test

```{r}
global_moran_test(wm_q_2017$total_cases,
                  wm_q_2017$nb,
                  wm_q_2017$wt,
                  zero.policy = TRUE)
```

::: callout-note
Moran I statistic (0.133140650) -\> indicates a positive correlation in the variable of interest (e.g., total cases).

SD of 2.4598 -\> suggests that Moran’s I is greater than the expected value under the null hypothesis.

P-value of 0.006951 -\> is \< 0.05, indicating strong statistical significance.

Expectation of -0.013333333 -\> suggests we would expect slight negative autocorrelation if there were no spatial structure.

Since the p-value \< 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. This strongly suggests there is significant positive spatial clustering of the variable in the study area (regions with high values are near areas with high values).

## Performing Global Moran’s I permutation test (Monte Carlo)

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

global_moran_perm_result_2017 <- global_moran_perm(wm_q_2017$total_cases,
                                              wm_q_2017$nb,

# Extract the simulated statistics and observed statistic
simulated_values <- global_moran_perm_result_2017$res

# To capture
hist(simulated_values, 
     freq=TRUE,

       col="red") 
```

::: callout-note
To ensure our results are accurate, we'll perform a Monte Carlo (permutation) test on Moran’s I statistic. This method helps us understand if the observed clustering of values is statistically significant.

First, we set the seed using `set.seed(1234)`. This step is crucial because it guarantees that our simulation results will be reproducible. Every time we run the simulation, we should get the same outcomes, which is important for consistency in our analysis.

Now, looking at the results from our permutation test:

-   **Moran’s I statistic**: 0.13314

-   **Observed rank**: 98

-   **P-value**: 0.04

The p-value being less than 0.05 tells us that there's strong statistical evidence against the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. This means we can conclude there’s significant positive spatial clustering in our data—areas with high values are near other areas with high values.

Looking at the summary of the simulated statistics, with the maximum being 0.162326 and the minimum at -0.151935. The distribution of these values helps us understand the expected behavior of our statistic under the null hypothesis.
:::
:::

::: callout-note
It's important to note that some areas may have no neighboring regions, which results in null weights. To address this, we use `zero.policy = TRUE` in our analysis, allowing regions with no neighbors to be included without causing errors in calculations.

However, it's essential to understand that Global Moran's I does not accommodate regions without neighbors in its calculations, meaning that these regions, even when included, will not contribute to the overall assessment of spatial autocorrelation.

Consequently, regions with null weights may still affect the results, leading to potential skewing of the analysis and limiting its interpretability. Therefore, careful consideration of how to handle such regions is crucial for ensuring accurate spatial analysis.

-   The results indicate a general trend of positive spatial autocorrelation from 2017 to 2022, with significant clustering observed in 2021 and 2022.

-   The years 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2022 show statistically significant evidence of clustering, while 2018 and 2020 have lower evidence of spatial correlation.

-   This trend suggests that the variable of interest tends to cluster in certain areas, particularly from 2021 onwards, which may warrant further investigation into the factors driving this clustering.
