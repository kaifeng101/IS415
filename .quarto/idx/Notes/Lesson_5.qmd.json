Applications: Often used in grid-based spatial models and geographic information systems (GIS) where spatial units are aligned in a regular pattern.\n\n![](images/clipboard-2503288394.png){width=\"588\"}\n\n## Distance Criterion\n\n-   defines spatial weights based on the distance between spatial units. (calculate the distance between the centroids or the nearest boundaries of the units)\n\n**Types:**\n\n-   **Fixed Distance:** Weights are assigned based on whether the distance between units is less than a specified threshold. For instance, units within 10 kilometers might be assigned a weight of 1, while others get a weight of 0.\n\n-   **Distance Decay:** Weights decrease with increasing distance, often following a specific functional form like the inverse of distance or a Gaussian function.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n\n-   **Continuous Matrix:** Results in a matrix where weights can vary continuously depending on the distance, not just a binary 1 or 0.\n\n-   **Flexibility:** Can handle irregular patterns and non-grid-based data.\n\n-   **Complexity:** Requires distance calculations and can be more computationally intensive.\n\n**Applications:** Useful in analyses where spatial units are not uniformly distributed, such as in ecological studies or when analyzing spatial interactions over varying distances.\n\n![](images/clipboard-3469777781.png){width=\"592\"}\n\n## General Spatial Distance weight matrices\n\n-   it generalize the distance criterion by allowing for various forms of distance-based weighting and are not restricted to binary or simple fixed-distance schemes.\n\n**Types:**\n\n-   **Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW):** Weights are inversely proportional to the distance.\n\n-   **Gaussian Weighting:** Weights are based on a Gaussian function of the distance.\n\n-   **K-nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Weights are assigned to the k nearest neighbors of each unit. This can be used to ensure a fixed number of neighbors regardless of distance.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n\n-   **Versatility:** Can accommodate various forms of distance relationships and decay functions.\n\n-   **Customizability:** Allows for fine-tuning of spatial relationships based on the specific needs of the analysis.\n\n-   **Complexity:** Can involve more complex calculations and parameter tuning.\n\n**Applications:** Suitable for a range of spatial models, including those needing flexible distance-weighting schemes or when the relationship between spatial units is not strictly binary.\n\n![](images/clipboard-948209757.png){width=\"584\"}\n:::\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Contiguity Neighbours\n\n-   Contiguity (common/shared boundary)\n\n![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson05/img/image6-8.jpg){width=\"539\"}\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n### Have 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc contiguity\n\n![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson05/img/image6-18.jpg){width=\"435\"}\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n### Weights matrix: \n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Adjacency-based neighbours\n\nNeighbour(s) of area 1202 using Rook case\n\n![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson05/img/image6-9.jpg){width=\"476\"}\n\n::: callout-important\nDo not include urself in the calculation\n:::\n\n## Distance-based neighbours\n\nWeights matrix for d = 650\n\n![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson05/img/image6-10.jpg){width=\"616\"}\n\n## Mesaured distance\n\n![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson05/img/image6-11.jpg)\n\n::: callout-note\nSame as Distance-based neighbours, but inverse\n:::\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n### For Point, there is no boundary, it is shared\n:::\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Row standardisation\n\nIn practice, we will use this instead of spatial weights\n\n![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson05/img/image6-12.jpg){width=\"503\"}\n\n::: callout-note\nCan use either row/col standardisation, it will give the same result\n:::\n\n# Applications of Spatial Weights\n\n![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson05/img/image6-17.jpg){width=\"405\"}\n\n::: callout-note\nYou are calculating the avg weight of ur neighbours, excluding yourself\n:::\n\n### Spatially Lagged Variables\n\nSpatial Lag with row-standardized weights\n\n![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson05/img/image6-19.png){width=\"663\"}\n\n### Spatially Window Sum\n\n-   uses and includes the diagonal element.\n\n![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson05/img/image6-20.png){width=\"658\"}\n\n::: callout-important\nSpatially Lagged Variables -\\> exclude yourself\n\nSpatially Window Sum -\\> including yourself\n\nWith the diagram on the right, is easier to tell if there is a diff between GDP per capital between East & West \\[processed data\\]\n\n**We can tell there is a spatial relationship,** not all the times we have\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Spatial Weights *(wij)*\n\n-   A way to define spatial neighbourhood\n\n![](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/lesson/lesson05/img/image6-6.jpg){width=\"375\"}\n\n::: callout-note\n## Note\n\nIt measure from centroid!\n\nNeed to clean data properly.
