This makes it more flexible and accurate in varied data densities.\n:::\n\n## Best Practice Guidelines\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## To get Reliable Results\n\n-   Ensure your dataset has at least 30 features.\n\n-   Use continuous numeric data (e.g., counts, rates). Avoid categorical data.\n\n## Choosing a Spatial Weighting Method\n\n-   **Polygon Contiguity:**\n\n    -   Good for similar-sized polygons.\n\n    -   Works when spatial interaction is stronger between neighboring polygons.\n\n    -   Use “row standardization” to balance the influence of polygons with different numbers of neighbors.\n\n-   **Fixed Distance:**\n\n    -   Ideal for point data or polygons with varying sizes.\n\n    -   Ensures consistent analysis by maintaining the same distance for all points.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Inverse Distance:**\n\n    -   Suitable for continuous data or processes where closer features interact more.\n\n    -   Can be computationally heavy because every feature can be a neighbor to every other feature.\n\n-   **K-Nearest Neighbors:**\n\n    -   Guarantees a minimum number of neighbors for each feature.\n\n    -   Useful when data values are skewed, ensuring context with at least eight neighbors.\n\n    -   Adjusts for varying feature distribution, adapting to sparse or dense areas.\n\n    -   Focuses on the number of neighbors, not fixed distance.\n\n## Choosing a Fixed-Distance Band\n\n-   Select a distance based on the spatial scale of the phenomenon you’re studying.\n\n-   Ensure all features have at least one neighbor within this distance.\n\n-   Don't worry about finding a single \"correct\" distance—multiple processes can influence clustering.\n\n-   Avoid making every feature a neighbor to all others.\n\n-   For skewed data, aim for each feature to have about eight neighbors.\n:::\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# **Emerging Hot Spot Analysis (EHSA)**\n\nCombines both **Hot Spot Analysis + Mann-Kendall Test**\n\n## Mann-Kendall Test for Trend\n\n-   **Purpose**: Determines if a set of values is increasing, decreasing, or stable over time.\n\n-   **Non-Parametric**: Works for any data distribution (doesn’t need to be normal).\n\n-   **No Serial Correlation**: Your data points should not be influenced by previous values in the series.\n\n-   **Hypotheses:**\n\n    -   **Null Hypothesis**: No trend exists (values are stable over time).\n\n    -   **Alternative Hypothesis**: A trend exists (values are consistently increasing or decreasing).\n\n-   **Limitations:**\n\n    -   It detects the direction of the trend but not how big the change is.\n\n    -   Needs at least 8-10 data points for reliable results. Fewer points increase the risk of missing real trends.\n\n-   Data Requirements for Mann-Kendall Test:\n\n    1.  **No Seasonal Data**: Avoid data that has regular fluctuations (e.g., only collected in summer and winter).\n\n    2.  **No Covariates**: Other factors shouldn’t influence your data. The test should only assess the trend of the specific variable you’re interested in.\n\n    3.  **One Data Point per Time Period**: If you have multiple data points for the same time, use the median value.\n\n## EHSA Patterns\n\n-   No pattern, New hot spot, Intensifying hot spot, Diminishing hot spot, Historical hot spot, Persistent hot spot\n\n-   Consecutive hot spot -\\> A place that recently became a hot spot with consecutive periods showing significant hot spot activity\n\n-   Sporadic hot spot -\\> A location that is a significant hot spot in the most recent time period but has had a mixed history of being a hot spot in the past.
